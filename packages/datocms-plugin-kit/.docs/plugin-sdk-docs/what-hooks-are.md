# What hooks are

Hooks are nothing but named JS functions that plugins can implement within their code.

A number of different hooks are made available by the SDK, each with a specific purpose and function. **By implementing hooks, plugins can add functionalities or tweak the interface** of a project in a controlled and safe way.

### What can plugins do?

You can read in detail about all the hooks in the following sections of the guide, but to give an overall view, a plugin can implement hooks to:

-   [Manage their config screen and user settings](config-screen.md)
    
-   [Render custom pages and link them from the DatoCMS navigation bars](custom-pages.md)
    
-   [Show custom sidebar panels when editing a record](sidebar-panels.md)
    
-   [Tweak/enhance the way fields can be edited](field-extensions.md)
    
-   [Open custom modals](modals.md)
    
-   [Intercept specific events happening on the interface, and execute custom code, or change the way the regular interface behaves.](event-hooks.md)
    

Other hooks will be made available in future versions of the SDK, to let plugins intervene in other places of the DatoCMS interface.
